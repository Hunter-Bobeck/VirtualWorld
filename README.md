# VirtualWorld – the framework for IU's first MMO

This repository contains a project template built with [Unity](https://unity3d.com) and [SpatialOS](http://www.spatialos.com). It demonstrates how to use SpatialOS to build a resource-driven multiplayer world. The goal is for future iterations of the project to evolve into Indiana University's first MMO (*massively multiplayer online*) game.

The framework is the product of Team A of the Virtual World Design course ([*MSCH-G290*](http://registrar.indiana.edu/browser/soc4172/MSCH/MSCH-G290.shtml)) taught by [Professor Edward Castronova](http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/profile/?p=castro) in conjunction with [Professor Mike Sellers](http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/profile/?p=sellers).


# Documentation

Currently, this is the starter HelloWorld project that you can use to build your own SpatialOS application.

Included are a couple of automated console command scripts:
* `Codegen.sh` – for compiling Spatial Schema "component" codes for Unity scripts to reference
* `Local Start.sh` – for starting the game locally (do this before playing the game in Unity)

For other command-running purposes, commands must be run through a GIT Bash shell in a local copy of the project root.
